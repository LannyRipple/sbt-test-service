# sbt-test-service Sandbox Test

This project demonstrates the use of the sbt-test-service plugin.
Run 'sbt clean publish-local' in the directory above this one
(which should be the sbt-test-service project).  Once that's done
you can 'sbt clean test' here.

Files you probably want to examine are

* build.sbt - configuration
* bin/service - test service start/stop script
* target/test-service.log - demonstrating the operational service
